### Profile
This is Simon Han's repository for UP221 - Intro to GIS and Spatial Data Science. 
I'm a first year MURP student. Formerly, I worked as a Landscape Desginer, and aspire to become a Transportation Planner. 

### Course Description
The goal for this course is to expose you to the foundations of spatial data science. 

### Project Idea
I'd like to conduct research on the homeless population's regional & local spatial patterns, with an focus on the unsheltered population living in vehicles. 

### Course Objective
I'd like to learn how to use data to make maps more informational and accurate.
